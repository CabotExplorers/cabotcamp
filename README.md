# Way Out West!
*Way Out West! (WOW!)* was a Virtual Summer Camp, run by [Cabot District](https://cabotscouts.org.uk) for Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Explorers, and Network members in the District.

The repository is in two parts:
## site
The main website, which serves a large amount of static content (activity links, section info booklets etc.), a programme for the camp which highlights relevant activities currently happening at that point in the event; and a system for young people to share photos/videos from their camp, which are moderated by the organising team before being made available to individual Scout Groups, and potentially shared on the website gallery.

## livestream
Is a lightweight Vue app which pulls some data (the photos/videos we've shared in the gallery, and an editable message) to be displayed over the live broadcast running for the weekend.
