# Cabot Camp
The repository is in two parts:

## site
The main website, which serves a large amount of static content (activity links, section info booklets etc.), a programme for the camp which highlights relevant activities currently happening at that point in the event; and a system for young people to share photos/videos from their camp, which are moderated by the organising team before being made available to individual Scout Groups, and potentially shared on the website gallery.

## livestream
A lightweight Vue app which pulls some data (the photos/videos we've shared in the gallery, and an editable message) and displays it so it can be shown over the live broadcast running for the event.
